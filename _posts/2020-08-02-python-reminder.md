A gui reminder app that I made to remind myself to do eye exercise after every few minutes while working in office. 

I chose to make it using python and its gui library tkinter so that its cross platform and can be quickly on any os.

I have planned to make it more customizable to choose the type of reminder and set interval via UI.
